# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Algorithms Repository
#its just me learning Machine learning and documenting it 

This repository contains multiple folders, each dedicated to **a single machine learning algorithm** applied to a specific dataset.
Every implementation follows a **real-world ML engineering workflow** â€” from data ingestion to model evaluation â€” so itâ€™s both a learning resource and a showcase of best practices.

## ðŸš€ Workflow Followed

1. **Problem Definition & Goal Setting** â€“ Understand dataset purpose and define success metrics.
2. **Data Acquisition & Ingestion** â€“ Load and validate dataset.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Visualize, detect patterns, and spot anomalies.
4. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** â€“ Handle missing values, scale, encode, and create features.
5. **Train-Test Split** â€“ Ensure reproducibility and fairness in data splits.
6. **Model Selection** â€“ Choose algorithm suitable for the task.
7. **Baseline Model Training** â€“ Build a quick benchmark for performance comparison.
8. **Hyperparameter Tuning** â€“ Use GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV to optimize parameters.
9. **Regularization / Pruning** â€“ Apply techniques to prevent overfitting.
10. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Compare results using performance metrics and visualizations.
11. **Model Interpretation** â€“ Use feature importance or explainability tools.
12. **Deployment & Documentation** â€“ Save model and document implementation.
